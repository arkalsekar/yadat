I will be adding other deep learning models to make it more robust. Also I am thinking of adding features such as Tagging or generating csv for the images detected with a particular face or something as such. If you have any thing to contribute feel free to make a Pull Request. Also if you have a feature to discuss or just want to say Hi. Feel Free to reach out to me on Twitter [@AbdGeeky](https://twitter.com/AbdGeeky)
